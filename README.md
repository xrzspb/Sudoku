difficulty to start the game. 
When game is over, a popup window will be displayed to let user
choose to restart or return to the starter page.

===========================
Code Structure
===========================
The whole structure are designed based on MVC framework.

1. View

  (1) View.jade: draws the basic UI, which is translated to HTML by 
                Jade engine automatically
                
  (2) SudokuView.js: it dynamicly draws UI of the sudoku board and
                    of the digits panel
                    
2. Model

  (1) SudokuGenerator.js: creates the board data model
  
  (2) SudokuSolver.js: manipulates the board data model
  
  (3) Cell.js: represents a cell object in the sudoku board. it 
              contains properties: row, column, value and possible values
              
3. Controller 

  (1) ViewController.js: handles user action events

4. Helper:

  (1) Config.js: contains constants which are used universally. 
                it defines dimension of the board so that we can create an
                advanced Soduku game in a larger board than 9*9

  (2) Util.js: contains general helper methods

============================
Unit Test
============================
using Qunit test framework to test logic in sudoku solver and in utility methods
